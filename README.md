# Parametric-Curves
Python code /w Manim to animate parametric curves

You can change func to be another parametric curve, setup line 7: np.array((x,y,z))
Be careful to check for divison by zeros or Manim will throw a fit. You can avoid by making more than one 
curve before and after the discontinuity.
